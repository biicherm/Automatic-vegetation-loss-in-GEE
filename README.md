# Automatic-vegetation-loss-in-GEE
The above code can be used for automatic image download, differencing and to finally mask out vegetation loss from the image before and after. Further work is underway to apply the global water mask and to flood fill the pixels for a refined image. All this was done in Google Earth Engine. The threshold value was arrived at using this equation (1.5* standard deviation)+ mean. The value 1.5 was gotten through trial and error and therefore its subject to human judgement and thus can change.
